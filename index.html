	<div id="index">
	<p align="left"> Almost every school has textbooks as their main source of education and their orthodox method of teaching wears students out a lot of the times. The solution to this is audiobooks. An audiobook (or talking book) is a recording of a text being read. 
	<br>
	<br>
	One of the reason audiobooks should be introduced in schools is that many students are very busy (especially in the IB diploma program). Homework, sports, extracurriculars, etc. It is a lot. Audiobooks enable them to listen to the books they need to read while doing chores, working out, on the bus or before they fall asleep. They can also increase the speed of the title to get through them faster as well. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Another reason that audibooks are useful in a school is the different levels of reading and understanding in each student. Some readers struggle to read at their age level or get discouraged from reading at all. Audiobooks are a great solution to allow them to follow the story and get comfortable again with literature.
